## Build instructions

* Download [fmod 1.05.15](http://www.fmod.org/download/) and move it to `/fmod`
* Download [OGRE 1.9 SDK for Mac OS X](http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk) and move it to `/OgreSDK`
* Download [Stockfish 6 for Mac](http://stockfishchess.org/download/) and move it to `/stockfish-6-64`
* Open chess.xcodeproj and build

## FYI...

C++, Ogre, fmod etc are not languages/frameworks I use regularly.

This is very much a side project for learning and a bit of fun.
